<h1>The Best Movies According to Daniel</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>I get excited with the whole plot twists of having different story line to make up the BIG MOUTH-WATERING STORY. I am also eager to know what my two best actors in the movies are up to; in persons of Arya Stark and Tyron Lannister (according to their movie name)</p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Interesting and filled with suspense. I feel the connection in the movie each time I rewatch it.</p>

<h3>Jumanji</h3>
<p>A very funny movie. I always love the combination of Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson</p>
